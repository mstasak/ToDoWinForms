# ToDoWinForms
ToDo Sample Project in C#, Windows Forms, EF, SQL Express LocalDB

Just starting, nothing works yet!

I'm planning to create a series of projects based on a simple single form daily task to-do list.

These projects will use different project types:
- Windows Forms
- WPF
- ASP.NET Web Forms
- ASP.NET Core 2.x MVC
- ASP.NET Core 2.x Razor Pages

These projects will use different back ends and/or ORM layers:
- SQL Express on a Unix server
- SQL Express LocalDB
- SQLite
- perhaps others (MySQL/Oracle/PostgreSQL/MongoDB)
