# ToDoWinForms
ToDo Sample Project in C#, Windows Forms, EF, SQL Express LocalDB

Just starting, nothing works yet!

I'm planning to create a series of projects based on a simple single form daily task to-do list.

The point of the project is to show in a limited amount of code different approaches to .NET data apps, and establish some starter baselines for more elaborate projects.

These projects will use different project types:
- Windows Forms
- WPF
- ASP.NET Web Forms
- ASP.NET Core 2.x MVC
- ASP.NET Core 2.x Razor Pages

These projects will use different database back ends:
- SQL Express LocalDB
- SQL Express on a VirtualBox-hosted Ubuntu server (maybe not, this (like SQL Express for Windows) is just a connection string mod and an exercise in VM networking configuration)
- perhaps others (SQLite / MySQL / Oracle[Express] / PostgreSQL / MongoDB)

These projects will use different ORM layers:
- raw DAO
- Entity Framework 6 (Core? Fluent? Strongly configured? Annotations?  If EF has an issue, it is too many approaches make it impossible to say the "right way" to do something)
- NHibernate
- Noticed some others in NuGet, might be worth trying them, particularly those on the simple, lightweight side
