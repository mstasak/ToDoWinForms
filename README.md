# ToDoWinForms
ToDo Sample Project in C#, Windows Forms, EF, SQL Express LocalDB

Just starting, nothing works yet!

I'm planning to create a series of projects based on a simple single form daily task to-do list.

These projects will use different project types:
- Windows Forms
- WPF
- ASP.NET Web Forms
- ASP.NET Core 2.x MVC
- ASP.NET Core 2.x Razor Pages

These projects will use different database back ends:
- SQL Express LocalDB
- SQL Express on a Unix server
- perhaps others (SQLite / MySQL / Oracle / PostgreSQL / MongoDB)

These projects will use different ORM layers:
- raw DAO
- Entity Framework
- NHibernate
